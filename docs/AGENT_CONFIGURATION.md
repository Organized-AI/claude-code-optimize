## ðŸ”„ Agent Coordination Protocol

### **Phase Handoffs**
1. **Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2**: Backend Enhancement Specialist completes API endpoints, Frontend Specialist takes over
2. **Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3**: Frontend Specialist completes dashboard, Reports Specialist adds comprehensive reporting
3. **Phase 3 â†’ Phase 4**: Reports Specialist completes functionality, Production Specialist polishes for release

### **Communication Between Agents**
- Each agent documents completion status in `docs/phase_X_completion_report.md`
- Next agent reads previous completion reports before starting
- Clear handoff criteria defined in success criteria files
- Shared understanding of project requirements through documentation

### **Quality Assurance**
- Each agent validates their work against success criteria
- Backward compatibility testing required at each phase
- Performance benchmarks must be met before phase handoff
- Documentation updated continuously throughout implementation
