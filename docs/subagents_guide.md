## Philosophy & Core Principles

### Anthropic's Three Core Principles for Agent Development

Based on Anthropic's official guidance from "[Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)" (Dec 19, 2024), all agent development should follow these foundational principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Start with the simplest solution possible, only increase complexity when it demonstrably improves outcomes
2. **Transparency**: Explicitly show the agent's planning steps and decision-making process
3. **Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)**: Invest as much effort in agent-computer interfaces as you would in human-computer interfaces

### Workflows vs Agents: Critical Distinctions

**Source**: [Anthropic Engineering Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)

- **Workflows**: Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths
  - More predictable and consistent
  - Lower cost and latency
  - Best for well-defined tasks

- **Agents**: Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage
  - More flexible and adaptive  
  - Higher cost and potential for errors
  - Best for open-ended problems requiring trust in LLM decision-making

**Key Insight**: Success isn't about building the most sophisticated system—it's about building the *right* system for your needs.

## Core Concepts

### What are Subagents?
Subagents are specialized AI agents designed to handle specific subtasks within a larger multi-agent system. They represent a key pattern for complex task decomposition, enabling:

- **Specialization**: Each subagent focuses on a specific domain or task type
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple subagents can work simultaneously on independent subtasks
- **Cost Optimization**: Use appropriate model sizes (Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex reasoning)
- **Scalability**: Add or remove subagents based on system needs

### Key Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Parallel processing reduces overall execution time
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Match model capability to task complexity
- **Modularity**: Easy to maintain, test, and update individual components
- **Reliability**: Isolated failures don't crash the entire system

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Orchestrator-Workers Pattern

**Description**: A central orchestrator LLM dynamically breaks down tasks and delegates them to worker LLMs (subagents).

**When to Use**: Complex tasks where subtasks cannot be pre-defined and depend on input analysis.

**Key Components**:
- **Orchestrator**: Analyzes input, decomposes tasks, synthesizes results
- **Workers**: Specialized subagents that process specific subtasks
- **Communication**: Structured XML/JSON for task assignment and result collection

### 2. Multi-LLM Workflows

**Basic Patterns**:

#### Prompt Chaining
- Sequential subtasks where each step builds on previous results
- Linear workflow with dependencies between steps
- Good for data transformation pipelines

#### Parallelization
- Independent subtasks processed concurrently
- No dependencies between subtasks
- Ideal for batch processing scenarios

#### Routing
- Dynamic selection of specialized paths based on input characteristics
- Content classification determines which subagent handles the request
- Perfect for customer support, content categorization

## Implementation Strategies

### Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) Design

**Source**: [Anthropic's Building Effective Agents - Appendix 2](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)

Tool definitions require as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts. Critical ACI design principles:

#### Format Selection Guidelines
- **Give models thinking space**: Provide enough tokens before writing into constraints
- **Natural text patterns**: Keep formats close to what models see naturally on the internet  
- **Minimize overhead**: Avoid string escaping, line counting, or complex formatting requirements
- **Example**: Use markdown code blocks instead of JSON with escaped newlines

#### Tool Documentation Best Practices
- **Write for junior developers**: Create clear docstrings with examples, edge cases, input formats
- **Poka-yoke design**: Structure arguments to make mistakes harder (e.g., require absolute paths instead of relative)
- **Test extensively**: Run many examples to see what mistakes the model makes, then iterate
- **Clear boundaries**: Distinguish similar tools with obvious parameter names and descriptions

#### Real-World Example
From Anthropic's SWE-bench agent: Models made mistakes with relative filepaths after changing directories. Solution: Changed tools to always require absolute filepaths—model used this flawlessly.

### Parallel Processing Patterns

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def parallel_process(prompt: str, inputs: List[str], n_workers: int = 3) -> List[str]:
    """Process multiple inputs concurrently with the same prompt."""
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=n_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(llm_call, f"{prompt}\nInput: {x}") for x in inputs]
        return [f.result() for f in futures]
```

### XML Structured Parsing

Essential for reliable communication between orchestrators and subagents:

```python
def extract_xml(response: str, tag: str) -> str:
    """Extract content between XML tags."""
    start_tag = f"<{tag}>"
    end_tag = f"</{tag}>"
    start_index = response.find(start_tag)
    end_index = response.find(end_tag)
    if start_index != -1 and end_index != -1:
        return response[start_index + len(start_tag):end_index].strip()
    return ""
```

### Task Parsing for Orchestrator-Workers

```python
def parse_tasks(tasks_xml: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Parse XML tasks into a list of task dictionaries."""
    tasks = []
    current_task = {}
    
    for line in tasks_xml.split('\n'):
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue
            
        if line.startswith("<task>"):
            current_task = {}
        elif line.startswith("<type>"):
            current_task["type"] = line[6:-7].strip()
        elif line.startswith("<description>"):
            current_task["description"] = line[12:-13].strip()
        elif line.startswith("</task>"):
            if "description" in current_task:
                if "type" not in current_task:
                    current_task["type"] = "default"
                tasks.append(current_task)
    
    return tasks
```

## Code Examples

### Complete FlexibleOrchestrator Implementation

```python
class FlexibleOrchestrator:
    """Break down tasks and run them in parallel using worker LLMs."""
    
    def __init__(self, orchestrator_prompt: str, worker_prompt: str):
        """Initialize with prompt templates."""
        self.orchestrator_prompt = orchestrator_prompt
        self.worker_prompt = worker_prompt
    
    def _format_prompt(self, template: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        """Format a prompt template with variables."""
        try:
            return template.format(**kwargs)
        except KeyError as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required prompt variable: {e}")
    
    def process(self, task: str, context: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Dict:
        """Process task by breaking it down and running subtasks in parallel."""
        context = context or {}
        
        # Step 1: Get orchestrator response
        orchestrator_input = self._format_prompt(
            self.orchestrator_prompt, task=task, **context
        )
        orchestrator_response = llm_call(orchestrator_input)
        
        # Parse orchestrator response
        analysis = extract_xml(orchestrator_response, "analysis")
        tasks_xml = extract_xml(orchestrator_response, "tasks")
        tasks = parse_tasks(tasks_xml)
        
        # Step 2: Process each task with workers
        worker_results = []
        for task_info in tasks:
            worker_input = self._format_prompt(
                self.worker_prompt,
                original_task=task,
                task_type=task_info['type'],
                task_description=task_info['description'],
                **context
            )
            
            worker_response = llm_call(worker_input)
            result = extract_xml(worker_response, "response")
            
            worker_results.append({
                "type": task_info["type"],
                "description": task_info["description"],
                "result": result
            })
        
        return {
            "analysis": analysis,
            "worker_results": worker_results,
        }
```

### Customer Support Routing Example

```python
def route_support_ticket(input: str, routes: Dict[str, str]) -> str:
    """Route support tickets to appropriate specialized subagents."""
    
    # Determine appropriate route
    selector_prompt = f"""
    Analyze the support ticket and select the most appropriate team from: {list(routes.keys())}
    
    <reasoning>
    Brief explanation of routing decision based on key terms, intent, and urgency.
    </reasoning>
    
    <selection>
    The chosen team name
    </selection>
    
    Input: {input}
    """
    
    route_response = llm_call(selector_prompt)
    reasoning = extract_xml(route_response, 'reasoning')
    route_key = extract_xml(route_response, 'selection').strip().lower()
    
    # Process with selected specialist
    selected_prompt = routes[route_key]
    return llm_call(f"{selected_prompt}\nInput: {input}")

# Example routing configuration
support_routes = {
    "billing": """You are a billing support specialist. Guidelines:
    1. Start with "Billing Support Response:"
    2. Acknowledge the specific billing issue
    3. Explain charges clearly
    4. List concrete next steps with timeline
    5. End with payment options if relevant""",
    
    "technical": """You are a technical support engineer. Guidelines:
    1. Start with "Technical Support Response:"
    2. List exact steps to resolve the issue
    3. Include system requirements if relevant
    4. Provide workarounds for common problems
    5. End with escalation path if needed""",
    
    "account": """You are an account security specialist. Guidelines:
    1. Start with "Account Support Response:"
    2. Prioritize security and verification
    3. Provide clear steps for account recovery
    4. Include security tips and warnings
    5. Set clear expectations for resolution time"""
}
```

## Best Practices

### Consistency Techniques

1. **Specify Output Format**
   - Use JSON, XML, or custom templates
   - Define every required output element
   - Provide clear structure examples

2. **Prefill Responses**
   - Start assistant response with desired format
   - Bypasses friendly preambles
   - Enforces consistent structure

3. **Constrain with Examples**
   - Provide concrete examples vs. abstract instructions
   - Show desired input/output pairs
   - Train subagent understanding

4. **Use Retrieval for Context**
   - Ground responses in fixed information sets
   - Maintain consistency across interactions
   - Essential for knowledge-based subagents

5. **Chain Prompts for Complex Tasks**
   - Break complex workflows into smaller subtasks
   - Each subtask gets full attention
   - Reduces inconsistency errors

### Error Handling and Reliability

```python
def robust_subagent_call(prompt: str, max_retries: int = 3) -> str:
    """Make LLM call with retry logic and error handling."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = llm_call(prompt)
            if response and len(response.strip()) > 0:
                return response
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
    
    raise Exception("Failed to get valid response after retries")
```

## Cost Optimization

### Model Selection Strategy

**Guidelines for Cost-Optimal Subagent Design**:

1. **Use Haiku for**:
   - Simple data extraction
   - Pattern recognition
   - Classification tasks
   - Well-defined transformations

2. **Use Sonnet for**:
   - Moderate complexity reasoning
   - Content generation
   - Analysis with some creativity
   - Multi-step logical tasks

3. **Use Opus for**:
   - Complex reasoning and synthesis
   - Orchestration and task decomposition
   - Creative and nuanced tasks
   - Critical decision-making

### Example: Document Analysis Pipeline

```python
class CostOptimizedDocumentAnalyzer:
    """Document analysis using cost-optimized model selection."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.extractor_model = "claude-3-haiku-20240307"  # Cheap extraction
        self.synthesizer_model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"  # Smart synthesis
    
    def analyze_documents(self, documents: List[str], question: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Use Haiku subagents for extraction (parallel)
        extraction_results = []
        with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            futures = [
                executor.submit(self._extract_with_haiku, doc, question) 
                for doc in documents
            ]
            extraction_results = [f.result() for f in futures]
        
        # Step 2: Use Opus for synthesis
        return self._synthesize_with_opus(extraction_results, question)
    
    def _extract_with_haiku(self, document: str, question: str) -> str:
        prompt = f"""Extract relevant information for: {question}
        
        Document: {document}
        
        Return only the relevant facts and data points."""
        return llm_call(prompt, model=self.extractor_model)
    
    def _synthesize_with_opus(self, extractions: List[str], question: str) -> str:
        combined_data = "\n\n".join([f"Extract {i+1}: {ext}" for i, ext in enumerate(extractions)])
        
        prompt = f"""Based on the following extracted information, provide a comprehensive answer to: {question}
        
        Extracted Information:
        {combined_data}
        
        Provide analysis, insights, and actionable conclusions."""
        return llm_call(prompt, model=self.synthesizer_model)
```
