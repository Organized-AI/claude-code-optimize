analyzer = SimpleProjectAnalyzer()
complexity = analyzer.analyze('/path/to/project')
print(f"Complexity: {complexity.level}, Model: {complexity.recommended_model}")

# Quota management with traffic lights
from src.planning.simple_rules import SimpleQuotaManager
quota_manager = SimpleQuotaManager()
status = quota_manager.get_traffic_light_status()
print(f"Status: {status['emoji']} {status['message']}")
```

## üìä INTELLIGENCE FEATURES

### Project Complexity Detection
```
Simple Project (1-2h):    ‚â§10 files, single language     ‚Üí Sonnet
Medium Project (3-4h):    11-50 files, 2-3 languages    ‚Üí Sonnet  
Complex Project (5h+):    50+ files, multiple languages ‚Üí Opus
```

### Traffic Light Quota System
- **üü¢ GREEN (<70%):** Safe - Normal usage recommended
- **üü° YELLOW (70-85%):** Warning - Plan sessions carefully  
- **üî¥ RED (>85%):** Critical - Use with extreme caution
