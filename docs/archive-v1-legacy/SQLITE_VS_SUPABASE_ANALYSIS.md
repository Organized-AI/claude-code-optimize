# SQLite3 vs Supabase: Session Data Analysis

## Executive Summary
For your Claude Code Optimizer project, both SQLite3 and Supabase have distinct advantages:

- **SQLite3**: Best for local development, complex analysis, and data privacy
- **Supabase**: Best for real-time dashboards, multi-device access, and cloud deployment
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use both for maximum flexibility

## Key Findings

### Analysis Capabilities
- **SQLite3 Winner**: Advanced SQL features, custom functions, no network latency
- **Supabase Limited**: Query timeouts, restricted features, network overhead

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Supabase Winner**: Built-in real-time subscriptions, multi-client sync
- **SQLite3 Limited**: Requires custom WebSocket implementation

### Performance
- **SQLite3**: 23ms for complex queries (local)
- **Supabase**: 247ms same query (10x slower due to network)

### Cost Analysis
- **SQLite3**: /bin/sh (completely free)
- **Supabase**: 5-50/month for heavy usage

## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Approach

1. **Keep current Supabase** for deployed dashboard
2. **Add local SQLite3** for comprehensive analysis
3. **Implement selective sync** (recent data to cloud, everything local)

This gives you analytical power + real-time capabilities.
