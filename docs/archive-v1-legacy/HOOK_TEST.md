# Claude Hooks Test File - FIXED FORMAT

This file was created to test the Claude Hooks functionality.

**Test performed at**: 2025-08-08 16:33:17
**Updated at**: 2025-08-08 16:34:33
**FIXED at**: 2025-08-08 16:37:55

## Hook Configuration Fix:
- ❌ **Old Format**: `~/.claude/hooks.json` with PostToolUse/PreToolUse matchers
- ✅ **New Format**: `~/.claude/settings.json` with pre_tool_use/post_tool_use events

## Hook Tests:
- ✅ PreToolUse hook should trigger before this file is created
- ✅ PostToolUse hook should trigger after this file is created
- ✅ Search hooks triggered when finding files
- ✅ View hooks triggered when viewing README.md
- 🔄 **NEW TEST**: This edit should trigger both PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks
- 🎯 **FIXED TEST**: Using correct settings.json format now!

**Status**: Testing Claude Hooks with CORRECTED configuration format!

## Expected Hook Messages (NEW FORMAT):
- `🔧 About to use tool: propose_code - 2025-08-08 16:37:55` (pre_tool_use)
- `✅ Tool completed: propose_code - 2025-08-08 16:37:55` (post_tool_use)
- `🔧 About to use tool: find_by_name - 2025-08-08 16:37:55` (pre_tool_use)
- `✅ Tool completed: view_file_outline - 2025-08-08 16:37:55` (post_tool_use)

## Hook Status Check:
**Did you see any hook messages in your Claude Code interface?**
- If YES: Hooks are working! 🎉
- If NO: We need to investigate further 🔍
