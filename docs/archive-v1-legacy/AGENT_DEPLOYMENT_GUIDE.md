## DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Immediate Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy all 3 agents in parallel using the provided coordination system:

```bash
# Option 1: Automated deployment (recommended)
python3 coordination/execution/deploy_agents.py

# Option 2: Manual agent deployment
# Deploy each agent using their individual prompt files
```

### Manual Agent Deployment

#### Deploy Agent 1: CLI Enhancement
```bash
# Use the system prompt from:
agents/cli_enhancement_agent.md

# Expected outcome:
# - Enhanced CLI tool src/cli/cco.py
# - ccusage-compatible commands
# - Power user extensions
# - Integration with existing APIs
```

#### Deploy Agent 2: Dashboard Simplification  
```bash
# Use the system prompt from:
agents/dashboard_simplification_agent.md

# Expected outcome:
# - Simple Mode components in src/components/simple/
# - Mode toggle functionality
# - ccusage-inspired minimalist design
# - Integration with existing dashboard
```

#### Deploy Agent 3: Planning Logic
```bash
# Use the system prompt from:
agents/planning_logic_agent.md

# Expected outcome:
# - Planning engine in src/planning/
# - Algorithm implementations
# - Integration APIs for CLI and dashboard
# - Rule-based optimization features
```

## EXPECTED RESULTS

### After Successful Deployment

#### Enhanced CLI Tool
```bash
# ccusage-compatible commands
cco daily              # Daily usage report
cco weekly             # Weekly usage with quota tracking  
cco sessions           # Session history with filtering
cco status             # Current session status

# Power user extensions
cco limits             # Traffic light quota system
cco plan myproject     # Project complexity analysis
cco recommend "debug"  # Model selection help
cco optimize           # Efficiency recommendations
cco blocks             # 5-hour block management
```

#### Dashboard Simple Mode
- Toggle switch between Simple and Advanced modes
- ccusage-inspired minimalist interface
- Essential metrics: current session, weekly quota, recent history
- Quick actions: Plan, Limits, History, Optimize

#### Planning Intelligence
- Automatic project complexity detection
- Traffic light quota warnings (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Session timing optimization based on efficiency patterns
- 5-hour block management with break recommendations

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Environment Problems
```bash
# Check Python version and dependencies
python3 --version && python3 -c "import sqlite3; print('SQLite OK')"

# Verify database access
ls -la claude_usage.db && echo "Database accessible"
```

#### Agent Coordination Issues
```bash
# Check agent prompt files exist
ls -la agents/*/agent.md

# Verify coordination system
python3 -c "from coordination.execution.agent_coordinator import AgentCoordinator; print('Coordination OK')"
```

#### Integration Problems
```bash
# Run integration tests
python3 coordination/integration/test_framework.py

# Check API endpoints
ls -la dashboard-server/ && echo "Dashboard server present"
```
