def create_optimal_schedule(project_complexity, available_time, user_preferences):
    """
    Creates optimized coding schedule with calendar integration
    """
    # Analyze project requirements
    estimated_hours = analyze_project_scope(project_complexity)
    
    # Calculate optimal session blocks
    session_blocks = calculate_session_blocks(estimated_hours, available_time)
    
    # Create calendar events with appropriate models
    calendar_events = []
    for block in session_blocks:
        event = {
            'type': block.type,  # coding, planning, testing, break
            'duration': block.duration,
            'model': recommend_model(block.complexity),
            'calendar_integration': True,
            'auto_break': block.duration >= 4.0
