# Phase 1 Success Criteria

## ✅ Backend API Requirements

### ccusage-Compatible Endpoints
- [ ] `GET /api/reports/daily` returns properly formatted JSON
- [ ] `GET /api/reports/weekly` aggregates by week correctly
- [ ] `GET /api/reports/monthly` aggregates by month correctly  
- [ ] `GET /api/reports/sessions` filters and sorts sessions
- [ ] `GET /api/reports/blocks` tracks 5-hour blocks
- [ ] All endpoints support query parameters (since, until, breakdown)
- [ ] Export formats work (JSON, CSV)

### Real-time Enhancement
- [ ] `GET /api/live/current-session` returns active session data
- [ ] `GET /api/live/block-progress` shows 5-hour block status
- [ ] WebSocket `/ws` broadcasts session updates
- [ ] WebSocket sends block progress updates
- [ ] Real-time updates occur within 2 seconds of changes

### Database Enhancement
- [ ] Migration scripts run without errors
- [ ] New columns added to claude_sessions table
- [ ] New analytics tables created successfully
- [ ] Indexes created for performance
- [ ] Historical data preserved and accessible

## 🔧 Performance Requirements
- [ ] API responses return within 1 second
- [ ] WebSocket connection stable (no drops)
- [ ] Database queries optimized (use indexes)
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable (<500MB additional)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing monitoring scripts

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- [ ] All new endpoints have unit tests
- [ ] WebSocket functionality tested
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified

## 📝 Documentation Requirements
- [ ] API endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] Database schema changes documented
- [ ] Migration procedures documented
- [ ] Performance metrics documented
- [ ] Known issues and limitations documented

## 🎯 Validation Commands
```bash
# Test all ccusage endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/api/reports/daily
curl http://localhost:3001/api/reports/weekly  
curl http://localhost:3001/api/reports/sessions
curl http://localhost:3001/api/reports/blocks

# Test real-time endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/api/live/current-session
curl http://localhost:3001/api/live/block-progress

# Test WebSocket (in browser console)
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3001/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));

# Test existing monitoring (should still work)
./monitors/unified-claude-monitor.sh
```
