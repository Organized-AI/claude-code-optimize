## 30% Cost Savings Roadmap
- **Current Progress:** 0.0%
- **Remaining Gap:** 30.0%
- **Timeline:** Aug 28, 2025 rate limit preparation

### Phase 1: Immediate Optimization
- **Timeline:** 0-2 weeks
- **Target Savings:** 10.0%
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Key Actions:**
  - Deploy intelligent model selector for all new tasks
  - Review and optimize high-cost sessions from last 30 days
  - Implement task complexity analysis in development workflow
  - Reduce Opus usage to <20% of total token consumption
  - Set up cost monitoring and alerts

### Phase 2: Usage Pattern Optimization
- **Timeline:** 2-6 weeks
- **Target Savings:** 12.0%
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Actions:**
  - Automate model recommendations in development tools
  - Train team on optimal model selection patterns
  - Implement batch processing and task grouping
  - Establish cost budgets per project/workflow
  - Optimize token usage through prompt engineering

### Phase 3: Advanced System Optimization
- **Timeline:** 6-12 weeks
- **Target Savings:** 8.0%
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Key Actions:**
  - Implement predictive cost modeling
  - Deploy automated task routing based on complexity
  - Implement caching and result reuse strategies
  - Advanced rate limiting and usage policies
  - Cross-project optimization and sharing

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Model Recommendations (Next 24 hours)
**Description:** Test the intelligent model selector with various task descriptions
**Expected Outcome:** Understand model recommendations for different complexity levels
**Command:** `python intelligent_model_selector.py claude_usage.db --recommend "your task description"`

### 2. Analyze Historical Usage (Next 24 hours)
**Description:** Run comprehensive analysis of historical usage patterns
**Expected Outcome:** Detailed report of optimization opportunities
**Command:** `python intelligent_model_selector.py claude_usage.db --analyze-optimization`

### 3. Implement Model Selection in Workflow (Next week)
**Description:** Integrate model recommendations into daily development workflow
**Expected Outcome:** Consistent use of optimal models for different task types

### 4. Set Up Cost Monitoring (Next week)
**Description:** Implement daily/weekly cost tracking and threshold alerts
**Expected Outcome:** Proactive cost management and optimization

### 5. Team Training and Documentation (Next month)
**Description:** Train team on cost optimization tools and create usage guidelines
**Expected Outcome:** Increased adoption and effective use of optimization tools

## Quick Start Examples

### Test Model Recommendations
