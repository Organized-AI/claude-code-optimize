# V1 Voice & Notification References

These files contain the voice hook and notification system from v1 that we want to adapt for v2.

## Files
- **voice.md** - Voice agent specification with multi-personality system (Alfred, Jarvis, Cortana)
- **test-notifications.sh** - Notification testing script showing integration patterns

## Key Features to Implement in V2
1. Multi-voice personality system
2. Context-aware audio notifications
3. macOS notification integration
4. Priority-based notification system (low, normal, critical)
5. Token rate warning notifications

See SESSION_1_START_PROMPT_UPDATED.md for implementation plan.
