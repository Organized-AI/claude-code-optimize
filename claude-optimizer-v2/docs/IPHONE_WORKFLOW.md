# iPhone Workflow - Manual Copy-Paste Guide

**Reality Check**: Custom URL schemes (`claude-session://`) work great on Mac but **are NOT clickable on iPhone** in calendar apps. This is an iOS limitation, not a bug.

**The Good News**: The manual workflow is simple, reliable, and actually works!

---

## ✅ What Works on iPhone

### Option 1: Manual Copy-Paste (Recommended - 100% Reliable)

**Setup**: None required - works out of the box!

**Steps**:
1. **View calendar event on iPhone**
   - Open Calendar app
   - Tap on your session event (e.g., "🤖 Claude Session: SESSION 12")

2. **Find the manual command**
   - Scroll down in event details
   - Look for section: `💻 MANUAL COMMAND (Mac):`
   - You'll see: `cd /path/to/project && node dist/cli.js session start 12`

3. **Copy the command**
   - **Press and hold** on the command text
   - Tap **Select All**
   - Tap **Copy**

4. **Switch to your Mac**
   - Open Terminal on your Mac
   - **Paste** (Cmd+V)
   - **Press Enter**

5. **Session starts!**
   - Claude Code launches with your session plan
   - All objectives loaded and ready to go

**Time**: ~20 seconds
**Reliability**: 100%
**Setup Required**: None

### Option 2: Simplified Command (Even Faster)

If you're already in your project directory on Mac:

**Calendar shows short version**:
```
📋 QUICK COMMAND:
node dist/cli.js session start 12
```

**Steps**:
1. Copy short command from iPhone
2. Paste in Terminal (already in project dir)
3. Run!

**Time**: ~10 seconds
**Works if**: You're already `cd`'d into the project

## ❌ What Doesn't Work on iPhone

### Custom URLs are NOT Clickable

**Why?**:
- iOS Calendar doesn't make custom URL schemes (`claude-session://`) clickable
- This is a platform limitation, not a bug in our system
- Only `http://`, `https://`, `tel://`, `mailto://` are clickable on iOS

**What happens if you tap them?**:
- Nothing - they appear as plain text
- No error, just not interactive

**Can this be fixed?**:
- Not without iOS Shortcuts or SSH (complex, unreliable)
- Manual copy-paste is actually simpler and more reliable

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### Weekend Planning

**Friday Evening** (5 minutes):
1. Export your weekend sessions to calendar:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js calendar export weekend-sessions.ics
   ```

2. Import to iPhone:
   - AirDrop `weekend-sessions.ics` to iPhone
   - Or email to yourself
   - Tap file → Add to Calendar

**Saturday/Sunday** (When starting session):
1. Check Calendar on iPhone → See next session time
2. Open laptop when session time arrives
3. Open Terminal
4. Copy command from iPhone → Paste in Terminal
5. Start working!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Reminders Work Great
- Calendar reminders (30 min, 5 min before) **DO work** on iPhone
- You get notifications even if URLs aren't clickable
- Tap notification → see event → copy command

### Tip 2: Use Emoji Prefixes
- Sessions have emoji in title: `🤖 Claude Session`
- Easy to spot in calendar
- Looks professional

### Tip 3: Project Path in Command
If command includes full path:
```bash
cd "/Users/jordaaan/Library/Mobile Documents/..." && node dist/cli.js session start 12
```

You can run from ANY directory - very convenient!

### Tip 4: Create Shortcuts
On Mac, create aliases in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
alias s10='cd /path/to/project && node dist/cli.js session start 10'
alias s11='cd /path/to/project && node dist/cli.js session start 11'
alias s12='cd /path/to/project && node dist/cli.js session start 12'
```

Then just type `s12` in Terminal!

## 🔮 Future Possibilities (Not Recommended)

These are **technically possible** but **not worth the complexity**:

### iOS Shortcuts (Complex, Unreliable)
- **Setup Time**: 30+ minutes
- **Reliability**: 60-70% (breaks with iOS updates)
- **Requires**: iPhone on same network as Mac, SSH configured
- **Verdict**: Skip it - manual is faster and more reliable

### SSH Remote Launch (Very Complex)
- **Setup Time**: 1+ hour
- **Reliability**: 80% (network dependent)
- **Requires**: SSH keys, port forwarding, static IP or DNS
- **Verdict**: Overkill for session launching

### Web Dashboard (Requires Server)
- **Setup Time**: 2+ hours
- **Reliability**: 95% (if server is up)
- **Requires**: Always-on server, ngrok/CloudFlare tunnel
- **Verdict**: Maybe for teams, not for solo use

## 📱 iPhone vs Mac Comparison

| Feature | iPhone | Mac |
|---------|--------|-----|
| View calendar events | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Perfect |
| Get reminders | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Perfect |
| See session details | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Perfect |
| Copy commands | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **Click URLs** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ **One-click!** |
| Auto-launch sessions | ❌ Manual only | ✅ **Automatic** |

**Bottom Line**: Use iPhone for **scheduling and viewing**, use Mac for **launching**.

## ✅ Summary

**What iPhone IS Good For**:
- 📅 Viewing your session schedule
- ⏰ Getting reminders when sessions start
- 📋 Copying commands to run on Mac
- 🗓️ Planning your weekend work

**What iPhone is NOT Good For**:
- 🚀 One-click session launching (Mac-only feature)
- 🔗 Clickable custom URLs (iOS limitation)

**The Manual Workflow**:
1. iPhone shows you WHEN to work
2. Mac is WHERE you actually work
3. Copy-paste bridges the gap (20 seconds)

**Is this acceptable?**
✅ **Yes!** Most developers have their Mac nearby when working. iPhone is your mobile schedule viewer, Mac is your work machine. This division of labor actually makes sense.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the manual command in the event"
- Make sure you exported calendar with latest version
- Re-export: `node dist/cli.js calendar export sessions.ics`
- Re-import to iPhone

### "The command doesn't work when I paste it"
- Make sure you copied the **entire command**
- Command should start with `cd` or `node`
- Try pasting in Mac Terminal (not iPhone app)

### "I want one-click on iPhone anyway"
- Consider: Is 20 seconds of copy-paste really a problem?
- Alternative: Use Mac calendar instead (URLs work there!)
- Future: We may add web dashboard (Session 12+)
