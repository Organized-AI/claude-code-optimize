# Claude Code Optimizer - Specialized Agents

This document defines the specialized Task agents available in the Claude Code Optimizer project. These agents can be invoked using the Task tool with specific `subagent_type` parameters.

---

## üîç gap-analysis-validator

**Purpose**: Validates session handoffs and completion documents by comparing planned objectives against actual implementation.

**When to Use**:
- Automatically after creating `SESSION_*_HANDOFF.md` files
- After creating `SESSION_*_COMPLETE.md` files
- Before starting a new session to verify prerequisites
- When you suspect features were missed or incomplete

**What It Does**:
1. **Reads Planning Documents**: SESSION_*_PLAN.md, SESSION_*_REVISED_APPROACH.md
2. **Analyzes Implementation**: Reviews actual code files created/modified
3. **Compares Planned vs Built**: Identifies gaps, missing features, incomplete work
4. **Finds Critical Issues**: Bugs, data mismatches, hardcoded values, broken integrations
5. **Generates Next Session Plan**: Creates detailed SESSION_N+1_PLAN.md with remediation steps
6. **Validates Success Criteria**: Checks if session goals were actually met

**Validation Checks**:
- ‚úÖ Were all planned files created?
- ‚úÖ Are all features from the plan implemented?
- ‚úÖ Do implementations match the design specs?
- ‚úÖ Are there any hardcoded values that should be dynamic?
- ‚úÖ Do data structures match between components?
- ‚úÖ Are all event handlers properly wired?
- ‚úÖ Is there any mock data that needs real sources?
- ‚úÖ Are there TODO comments or unfinished code?
- ‚úÖ Do success criteria pass validation?

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
// After creating SESSION_9_HANDOFF.md
Task({
  subagent_type: 'gap-analysis-validator',
  description: 'Validate Session 9 handoff',
  prompt: `
    Validate the Session 9 handoff and create Session 10 plan.

    Session to validate: 9
    Handoff document: SESSION_9_HANDOFF.md

    Perform complete gap analysis:
    1. Read all Session 9 planning docs
    2. Review actual implementation files
    3. Identify gaps and issues
    4. Create SESSION_10_PLAN.md with remediation
  `
});
```

**Output**:
- Creates `SESSION_N+1_PLAN.md` with comprehensive gap analysis
- Reports critical issues found
- Categorizes missing features by priority
- Provides token/time estimates for fixes
- Includes ready-to-use kickoff prompt for next session

**Tools Available**: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash (for git operations)

## üéØ General Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Task Agents

**DO use Task agents when**:
- Task requires multiple steps and complex reasoning
- You need specialized domain knowledge
- Search requires multiple rounds of iteration
- Want automated validation and quality checks
- Need comprehensive analysis across many files

**DON'T use Task agents when**:
- Reading a specific known file path (use Read instead)
- Searching for specific class definition (use Glob instead)
- Searching within 2-3 specific files (use Read + Grep instead)
- Simple one-step operations

### Best Practices

1. **Launch Multiple Agents in Parallel**: When tasks are independent, use a single message with multiple Task calls
2. **Provide Clear Objectives**: Specify exactly what you want the agent to accomplish
3. **Specify Output Format**: Tell the agent what to return and where to save results
4. **Trust Agent Outputs**: Agents are designed to be autonomous and thorough
5. **Use Proactively**: Don't wait for issues - run gap-analysis-validator after every handoff

### Example: Parallel Agent Execution

```javascript
// Launch multiple agents in a single message
[
  Task({
    subagent_type: 'gap-analysis-validator',
    description: 'Validate Session 9',
    prompt: 'Validate SESSION_9_HANDOFF.md and create SESSION_10_PLAN.md'
  }),
  Task({
    subagent_type: 'dependency-validator-installer',
    description: 'Validate dependencies',
    prompt: 'Ensure all dependencies are installed for Session 10'
  })
]
```

## üîÑ Agent Workflow Patterns

### End-of-Session Workflow

```
1. Create handoff document (SESSION_N_HANDOFF.md)
2. Launch gap-analysis-validator agent
3. Review gap analysis output
4. Commit handoff + next session plan
5. (Optional) Launch dependency-validator-installer for next session
```

### Start-of-Session Workflow

```
1. Read SESSION_N_HANDOFF.md
2. Read SESSION_N_PLAN.md (from gap analysis)
3. Launch dependency-validator-installer if needed
4. Follow plan implementation phases
5. Create SESSION_N_COMPLETE.md when done
6. Launch gap-analysis-validator for SESSION_N+1
```

### Continuous Improvement Workflow

```
Weekly:
- Launch analytics-insights-specialist
- Review usage patterns
- Apply optimization recommendations

Monthly:
- Launch model-selection-optimizer
- Review cost analytics
- Adjust model usage strategy
```
