# 🎯 System Process Events Consolidation

## What Changed
System process monitoring has been **consolidated** to reduce clutter in the activity feed!

### ✅ **New Process Status Bar**
A dedicated status bar now shows the **real-time status** of:
- **Claude Desktop** - Shows Running (with PID) or Stopped
- **Claude CLI** - Shows Running (with PID) or Stopped

### 📊 **How It Works**

#### Before (Cluttered):
- Every 60 seconds: "System: process" appeared in feed
- Repeated "running" messages even when nothing changed
- Feed filled with redundant process checks

#### After (Consolidated):
- **Status Bar**: Always visible process indicators
  - 🟢 Green = Running
  - 🔴 Red = Stopped
- **Activity Feed**: Only shows **status changes**
  - "Claude Desktop started"
  - "Claude Desktop stopped"
  - No repeated "running" messages

### 🎨 **Visual Design**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Process Status:                     │
│ [🟢 Claude Desktop: Running (12345)]│
│ [🔴 Claude CLI: Stopped]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 💡 **Benefits**
1. **Cleaner Feed** - No more repetitive process messages
2. **Better Visibility** - Process status always visible at a glance
3. **Change Notifications** - Feed only shows when status actually changes
4. **Improved Performance** - Less DOM updates for unchanged statuses

### 📝 **Technical Implementation**
- Process events intercepted before adding to feed
- Internal state tracks current status
- UI updates only on status changes
- Status change events still logged to feed with 🔄 icon

## Result
The Live Activity Feed now focuses on **meaningful events** while process status is **always visible** in a dedicated status bar! 

No more scrolling through endless "process running" messages! 🎉
