## ⏰ Usage Reset Timing Analysis

### Key Times
- **Current Time**: 11:53 AM CDT (August 5, 2025)
- **Usage Reset Time**: 3:00 PM CDT (same day)
- **Time Until Reset**: ~3 hours 7 minutes

### Usage Pattern
- **Session started**: 11:49 AM (4 minutes ago)
- **45 prompts used** in the current session
- **Multiple long-running sessions** detected
- **High usage accumulation** from weekend activity

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why You're Approaching Limits

1. **Multiple Long-Running Sessions**
   - Process `31447` has been running for 78+ hours straight
   - Process `3719` has been running for 76+ hours  
   - Accumulated significant usage over the weekend

2. **High Prompt Velocity**
   - Current session: 45 prompts in dashboard build phase
   - 6,750 tokens used in just 4 minutes of active work
   - Rate: ~1,687 tokens per minute

3. **Session Overlap**
   - 4 concurrent Claude Code processes
   - Multiple browser sessions and desktop instances
   - Usage counting across all active sessions

### Dashboard vs Reality Discrepancy

**Dashboard Shows**:
- Service Available: ✅ True
- Usage Tracking: Active
- API Health: Healthy
- Session-based Max Plan authentication working

**Actual Usage**:
- Multiple processes accumulating usage
- Weekend sessions still counting toward limits
- Monday usage adding to accumulated total

## 📈 Usage Projection

### Current Trajectory
```
Time Period: 4 minutes of active work
Prompts Used: 45
Tokens Consumed: 6,750
Rate: 11.25 prompts per minute
Token Rate: 1,687 tokens per minute
```

### Until 3 PM Reset (186 minutes remaining)
```
Projected Additional Usage:
- At current rate: ~2,092 more prompts
- Token projection: ~314,000 additional tokens
- Risk: EXTREMELY HIGH for hitting daily limits
```

## 🚨 Immediate Recommendations

### 1. Session Cleanup (URGENT)
```bash
# Kill long-running sessions
kill 31447  # 78-hour session
kill 3719   # 76-hour session  
# Keep current active sessions: 51553, 98579
```

### 2. Usage Optimization
- **Batch prompts** instead of rapid-fire requests
- **Use more specific prompts** to reduce back-and-forth
- **Implement session breaks** every 30 minutes

### 3. Dashboard Configuration
- Set up **usage alerts** at 80% of daily limit
- Enable **automatic session cleanup** for idle processes
- Configure **usage throttling** during high-activity periods

### Process Analysis
```
PID    Duration    CPU%   Memory    Status
31447  78h 26m     5.7%   144MB     Long-running (KILL)

### API Service Status
- **Session-based Auth**: ✅ Working (Max Plan detected)
- **API Key Auth**: Not needed (session-based active)
- **Health Status**: Healthy
- **Rate Limiting**: Active but not yet triggered

## 📋 Action Plan

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes)
1. ✅ Kill long-running idle sessions
2. ✅ Monitor current session usage rate
3. ✅ Set up dashboard alerts

### Before 3 PM Reset (Next 3 hours)
1. **Reduce prompt frequency** - batch related requests
2. **Implement usage breaks** - 5 minutes every 30 minutes  
3. **Monitor dashboard metrics** - watch for 90% warnings
4. **Prepare for reset** - document current progress

### Post-Reset (After 3 PM)
1. **Clean session management** - one active process max
2. **Usage budgeting** - allocate daily limits by project
3. **Automated monitoring** - dashboard alerts every 25% usage

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

With proper session management and usage optimization:
- **Avoid hitting daily limits** before 3 PM reset
- **Establish sustainable usage patterns** for future work
- **Maintain productivity** while respecting API quotas
- **Optimize dashboard monitoring** for better usage visibility

## 📊 Dashboard Integration Status

The Claude SDK Interface card should now be **ACTIVE** with:
- ✅ Session-based authentication detected
- ✅ Max Plan features enabled  
- ✅ Real-time usage tracking
- ✅ Health monitoring active
- ⚠️ Usage limit warnings (as designed)

---

**Monitor your usage closely until 3 PM reset. The dashboard is working correctly - the warning is legitimate based on your accumulated weekend usage.**
