# DNS Configuration for dashboard.organizedai.vip

## 🌐 DNS Setup Required

To complete the deployment to `dashboard.organizedai.vip`, you need to add a DNS record in your Cloudflare dashboard:

### DNS Record Configuration
```
Type: A
Name: dashboard

TTL: Auto
```

### Steps to Configure DNS:

1. **Log into Cloudflare**

   - Click "Save"

3. **Verify Configuration**
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for DNS propagation
   - Test with: `nslookup dashboard.organizedai.vip`
   - Should return: `76.76.21.21`

## 🔧 Alternative: CNAME Record
If you prefer using a CNAME record:
